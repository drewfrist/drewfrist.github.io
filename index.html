	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm a graphic designer, living in West Los Angeles. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because of the increasing need for designers to know how to develop, customize, and improve clients’ web-based projects and, at the very least, speak to their developers in a common language.</p>
	<h3>My Mission</h3>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a print designer with his own online print store because I like to work in a self-fueled work environment that fosters limitless creative play.</p>
