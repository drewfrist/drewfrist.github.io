<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p>Find <a href="http://www.semplicelabs.com/">Semplice Lab's</a> Wordpress-based portfolio site to be a pretty impressive mix of formal design elements + 'wow' factor. Second example is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, a favorite, daily news and tech site.</p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<p>Semplice Lab's site makes the most of its type. It features a minimal layout, a simple color palette, and a responsive-friendly up/down flow of content. The simplicity lays a simple hierarchyâ€”size and color. The information and site "story" all seems to fall into place as you scroll through. It also leaves the site ripe for the kind of interaction that makes a great responsive & mobile-friendly site. Wide, large images give the site a super architected and visual feel.<br>

The Verge deals with far more content on a per-page basis, but its frontpage design manages to turn a pretty traditional media/news site into an easyily digestable block design. Space is left on either side of the main, central sqaure that lives above the fold. A more complex grid breaks down the 'main news' feed into news squares. Size begins to dictate the importance & relevance of the news. The wider the square and the larger the text, the more important the story. </p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>Both sites make great use of the grid and type, but I think the biggest difference in design comes down to flow and what kind of content they were built for.<br>

Semplice has created a template to showcase an artist or designer's work, and it does so in a way that becomes almost an art piece unto itself. The end user can flick and click up and down at their leisure. A single page, I believe, is meant to feel like a whole. Not a bunch of pieces or content that makes up a homepage, but one message. It also plays with the large size of the desktop screen more so than The Verge, which sticks to a central block of content that stays static after a certain pixel width. The Verge also uses the grid to explicityly parse out the content. Visitiros to the site are shown the top news above the fold (unlike Semplice, which de-emphasizes the fold by working with a horizonal divider over and over again), the grid helping to play up and play down the most important stories. As you scroll down the information gets a little less important. The advertisign is grouped and presented in much the same way. The design creates a sort of purposeful confusion. Advertorial. Feel like this could be different. Also, it feels like there isn't tons of reasons to go back to the homepage. Go to stories then jump out of site.</p>
